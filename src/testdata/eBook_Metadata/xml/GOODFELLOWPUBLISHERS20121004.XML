    <d104>Billions of dollars are lost every year from marketing plans that fail to get implemented properly.  The risks around implementation are high and the challenges are many.  This book draws upon fresh research, new technology and decades of experience to help marketers improve their chances of success. The authors propose a practical marketing navigation system to help all businesses ensure their plan identifies the implementation risks and remains on course to deliver its targets.  

The book is packed with examples from organizations of every size, from both manufacturing and service sectors, and from around the world. They show the variety of challenges experienced and the lessons we can all learn about how those challenges were overcome. They demonstrate:
&#8226;	tried-and-tested ideas from other professions that you can import and adapt easily for your implementation purposes
&#8226;	how you can use your existing marketing skills in new ways to sell your plan internally
&#8226;	a simple but powerful tool that you can use to help ensure your plan is always on course and on schedule.  It will become your steering wheel and GPS for the journey ahead.

The book will be essential reading for marketing managers and strategists, trainers and anyone doing executive courses in the field. For professionals and students alike it will help the process of developing your thinking from marketing management to full scale marketing strategy implementation.

* Includes several brand new chapters such as: Event and Function Management Accounting techniques, Sustainability &amp; Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), Not-for-profit Organisations, Current Issues in Strategic Management Accounting;
* Uses international real life case studies to illustrate from across the hospitality, tourism and events sectors including charity (not-for-profit) sector and music events;
* Links to applied and generic research on each topic;
* Includes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) terminology suitable for an international audience.

It has a user friendly chapter structure, with pedagogic features including objectives, learning activities, self check questions, references, and key points summaries. Each chapter includes &#8216;theoretical context&#8217; sections which put the applied learning in the context of current research and thinking to bring the theory to life.

Key features of this text are:

* A complete revision and expansion of the well known and successful Harris and Hazzard text;
* Includes several brand new chapters such as: Event and Function Management Accounting techniques, Sustainability &amp; Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), Not-for-profit Organisations, Current Issues in Strategic Management Accounting;
* Uses international real life case studies to illustrate from across the hospitality, tourism and events sectors including charity (not-for-profit) sector and music events;
* Links to applied and generic research on each topic;
* Includes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) terminology suitable for an international audience.
