They all have a range of features ensuring their quality and applicability:
* Based on a joint  initiative of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the BEST Education Network (BEST EN), organisations that  are at the the forefront of both sustainable tourism practice and teaching;
* Each case is rigorously and carefully structured for maximum teaching and learning impact-  this includes a clear synopsis, appropriate theoretical frameworks, and a clear summary and future outlook;
* Every case  is fully supported by features to increase deep understanding of the principles and practice it contains- clear learning outcomes, full references and directed reading and challenging study questions;
* In addition to each case the  authors provide educators and trainers with detailed background teaching notes, indicative answers,  a recommended teaching approach and teaching slides in PowerPoint;
* All the cases are also available online for individual purchase at www.goodfellowpublishers.com and for library and site purchase through all major online suppliers

The book, and the individual cases will be an essential teaching and learning resource for both undergraduate and graduate students in Tourism.

    <d104>Case studies are an indispensable learning tool, not only in the classroom but also in academic research, consultancy and practical business management contexts. Case studies present real situations, allowing a balance of theory and practice. They have the power to transform the learning the abstract and uninspiring to one that is targeted and vibrant.

International Cases in Sustainable Travel &amp; Tourism provides an international range of outstanding new cases  focused on sustainable tourism management and development, including award winners and finalists from the WTTC Tourism for Tourism Awards they are written by local scholars who are experts in sustainable tourism. They all have a range of features ensuring their quality and applicability:

* Each case is rigorously and carefully structured for maximum teaching and learning impact-  this includes a clear synopsis, appropriate theoretical frameworks, and a clear summary and future outlook;
* Every case  is fully supported by features to increase deep understanding of the principles and practice it contains- clear learning outcomes, full references and directed reading and challenging study questions;

    <d104>The originality of this text lies in its combination of a wide range of knowledge, theory and best practice that has so far been widely distributed across a range of sources. Drawing all this together allows the authors to offer a much needed multifaceted but carefully integrated overview of managing and promoting the tourist experience.

For students and practitioners alike it will make clear both in theory and in practice:
&#8226;	What really lies at the heart of the customer experience;
&#8226;	How to manage and improve service provision;
&#8226;	How to influence the customer experience;
&#8226;	Key examples illustrating real world success. 

The topic of &#8216;experience&#8217; is becoming central to a proper and full understanding of consumer behaviour and the book covers the key sectors where it is a critical factor- from resort management and tourist information to destination marketing. International in scope and applicability it backs up the theory throughout with relevant case materials, questions and exercises.
Written by experienced educators it is ideal for upper level students in tourism marketing and tourism management, and important for all practitioners and managers who also need to understand the principles and practice of experiential and tourism marketing, tourist behaviour, service quality and customer experience.

    <d104>The originality of this text lies in its combination of a wide range of knowledge, theory and best practice that has so far been widely distributed across a range of sources. Drawing all this together allows the authors to offer a much needed multifaceted but carefully integrated overview of managing and promoting the tourist experience.
For students and practitioners alike it will make clear both in theory and in practice-

&#8226;	How to manage and improve service provision
&#8226;	How to influence the customer experience

International in scope and applicability it backs up the theory throughout with relevant case materials, questions and exercises.
Written by experienced educators it is ideal for upper level students in tourism marketing and tourism management, and important for all practitioners and managers who also need to understand the principles and practice of experiential and tourism marketing, tourist behaviour, service quality and customer experience.

&#8226;	How to manage and improve service provision
&#8226;	How to influence the customer experience
&#8226;	Key examples illustrating real world success

    <d104>Billions of dollars are lost every year from marketing plans that fail to get implemented properly.  The risks around implementation are high and the challenges are many.  This book draws upon fresh research, new technology and decades of experience to help marketers improve their chances of success. The authors propose a practical marketing navigation system to help all businesses ensure their plan identifies the implementation risks and remains on course to deliver its targets.  

The book is packed with examples from organizations of every size, from both manufacturing and service sectors, and from around the world. They show the variety of challenges experienced and the lessons we can all learn about how those challenges were overcome. They demonstrate:

&#8226;	tried-and-tested ideas from other professions that you can import and adapt easily for your implementation purposes
&#8226;	how you can use your existing marketing skills in new ways to sell your plan internally
&#8226;	a simple but powerful tool that you can use to help ensure your plan is always on course and on schedule.  It will become your steering wheel and GPS for the journey ahead.

The book will be essential reading for marketing managers and strategists, trainers and anyone doing executive courses in the field. For professionals and students alike it will help the process of developing your thinking from marketing management to full scale marketing strategy implementation.

    <d104>Strategic Managerial Accounting: Hospitality, Tourism &amp; Events Applications 6edn explores the nature of these industry sectors and how these impact on the strategic managerial accounting (SMA) tools used by decision makers in the industry.

Formerly known as Managerial Accounting in the Hospitality Industry by Harris and Hazzard, this new edition builds on this successful and well known text, retaining its practical approach and active learning style, extending to consider strategic management accounting and to include tourism and events management industry contexts.

This new 6th edition incorporates discussion, explanations and illustrations of the theoretical underpinning of hospitality, tourism and events related to SMA and managerial accounting concepts and techniques, together with specific examples of industry application. It has a user friendly chapter structure, with pedagogic features including objectives, learning activities, self check questions, references, and key points summaries. Each chapter includes &#8216;theoretical context&#8217; sections which put the applied learning in the context of current research and thinking to bring the theory to life.

Key features of this text are:

* A complete revision and expansion of the well known and successful Harris and Hazzard text;
* Includes several brand new chapters such as: Event and Function Management Accounting techniques, Sustainability &amp; Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), Not-for-profit Organisations, Current Issues in Strategic Management Accounting;
* Uses international real life case studies to illustrate from across the hospitality, tourism and events sectors including charity (not-for-profit) sector and music events;
* Links to applied and generic research on each topic;
* Includes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) terminology suitable for an international audience. 

With a complete suite of online tutor resources, this book is essential reading for all year 2/3 undergraduate and postgraduate students studying hospitality, tourism and events management.</d104>
